# Ngnix Virtual Hosts

For demonstration purposes were created three apps examples:
- site1: whose assets files use root absolute path
- site2: whose assets files use relative path
- site3: sample of SPA (build of react app) 

Note: assets folder was placed on same level of apps to illustrate calls to root domain.

## Question
As multiple site (can be SPA too) can be on the same domain?
